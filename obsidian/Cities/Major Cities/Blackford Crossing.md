## Overview
**Blackford Crossing** is a small town located on the banks of the [[Mirar River]], approximately 30 miles upstream from [[Luskan]]. It is a crossroads of sorts, with the Blackford Road leading south to [[Mirabar]] and the Eastway leading east to [[Neverwinter]]. The town is home to a small population of farmers, merchants, and travelers.

  

## Government
Council of three - one representative of the merchants, one chosen by the people, and the captain of the guard. The council elects a mayor to deal with all practical matters and do the actual ruling.

Currently, the council consists of [[Doran Blackheart]] (Innkeeper), [[Thalin Silvershield]] (Captain of the Guard), and [[Gimble Goldfist]] (Merchant). Their elected mayor remains [[Ianna Talltree]] who manages the town quite efficiently.

  

## Industry & Trade

While few things are produced in **Blackford Crossing**, a lot of them are traded between merchants from [[Luskan]] or [[Mirabar]], making the town much richer than it has any right to be.
