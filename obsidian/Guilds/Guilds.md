# [[Adventurer's Guild]]

An organization that oversees Adventurers. Adventurer’s Guilds are standard across the world but each one varies in terms of competency, size, and so forth. This is the place where adventurers hang out, source jobs, and collect their rewards.

## Reputation

Your reputation with a guild is judged by your interactions and work completed with the guild. Guild rankings can vary from guild to guild, but favorability is calculated on a scale from -5 to 5 with 0 being neutral.

Guild Ranking: Unregistered

Guild Favorability: 0 (Neutral)

## Ranks

Initiate

First rank you will begin as. Initiates will be allowed to take basic local jobs and can only utilize basic guild services. Completing a few quests successfully will allow a group to prove themselves and advance ranks.

Bronze

Most adventuring groups will fall under this category. Bronze ranks are often given the jobs that aren't necessarily harder, but often described as grunt work. Stick with the tasks given and you are sure to advance in the ranks.

Silver

At silver rank, adventuring parties are starting to gain regional notoriety and will be allowed to take on more difficult jobs that will help improve the way that the people in the world see them. At this point advancement is handled on a case by case basis and depends on what the group has done for the realm.

Gold

Gold rank parties are typically a force to be reckoned with. Kings, lords, and high ranking military officials will often seek you out to help them with tasks that are not fit for the lower ranks of the guild. Even the best of adventuring parties will often remain gold rank as advancing to platinum is seen as nearly impossible, or at least more difficult than most adventurers are capable of.

Platinum

The best of the best. Platinum ranking adventuring parties are seen as true heroes, capable of anything. Your reputation precedes you across the realm and you may be approached by extremely powerful beings to help them with tasks that often change the world.

## Services

  

Job Posting Desk (8am-5pm availability)

All Ranks

During business hours(8am - 5pm), the Job Posting Desk will be manned by guild employees. Depending on your guild rank, you will either be presented with job options or need to request from a list of local jobs.

From bronze rank and on, you will be able to post your own jobs for other adventuring groups to complete for you. You cannot sub-contract existing jobs you have taken from the Adventurer's Guild, but you can make job postings for other guild's or post jobs that help you with your own goals.

  

Stables (24hr availability)

All Ranks

One of the best features that can be found at all chapters of the Adventurer's Guild are the stables. The stables are staffed 24hrs a day and can hold your mounts and wagon while you conduct your business within the city. If you require longer term care for your animals you can look into stables, but they will come at a cost per day.

  

Gear Storage (24hr availability)

All Ranks

All Adventurer's Guild chapters will have a place for parties to store gear as long as they remain member's of the guild. This gear will be stored in a bag of holding which allows for 500lbs worth of gear, as long as it can be contained within a 4ft cube (64 cubic ft). Gear is stored in a guarded vault that is basically a bunch of locked safety deposit boxes with bags of holding inside. The bag of holding can be removed from the deposit box to insert items, but cannot be taken out of the vault. Gear can be transferred(in it's entirety) for a fee that is determined by the distance between guild chapters.

Gear Transfer Rate: 5sp/1mi (1gp/2mi).

Recruit

Unlike the Adventurer's Guild, a member of the Assassin's guild will seek you out and initiate you into the group as a Recruit.

Showing that you are able to follow the direction of higher ranking members will help you climb to the next rank.

Bounty Hunter

You begin to gain the trust of the organization and will be allowed to accept tasks that involve bringing in persons of interest alive whenever possible. Continue to do clean work without major incidents to gain full trust of the organization.

Assassin

Your group has proven themselves to carry out tasks for the guild with the utmost discretion. You will now be trusted with functioning as a hitman for the guild. Assassins are expected to be capable of being tactical, resourceful, and most of all unseen.

Contract Desk (24hr availability)

All Ranks

A member of the guild will always be at the contract desk to both accept contracts and assign members.

Members are allowed to turn these contracts down, but if done too often, their favorability may fall with the guild.

  

Informant (24hr availability)

All Ranks

A member of the guild will always be around to provide additional information related to contracts that are given out to increase the chances of success for the guild. Due to the nature of the work, information is always on a need-to-know basis, however you will often still receive more than you would from the Adventurer's Guild's researcher, even as a recruit.

  

Local Ambassador (24hr availability)

All Ranks

The Assassin's Guild has it's hands in about every organization within the realm and are capable of providing many different services to help you get the job done. These jobs are very open ended and thus the price for these services can vary drastically.

You will be given tasks that test your skills in places that have already been extensively surveyed by more advanced surveyors. Proving your skills and maintaining a healthy relationship with the guild will almost guarantee progression in the ranks. Once you obtain any one of the ranks, you will no longer be a recruit

You become more skilled at utilizing surveyor’s tools properly and thus your surveying distance increases to a 15mi radius from your party’s token on the world map.

Building surveyor

Building Surveyors are great at measuring and assessing the condition of buildings and other structures. This could include identifying structural issues, recommending repairs, and estimating the value of the property.

Benefits: With a solid understanding of structural components of buildings and structures, a building surveyor is able to roll with advantage when it comes to their perceptions of structural components such as a bridge or floorboards someone may fall through.

In fair conditions, actively searching to find your way back to a trail will give you advantage on your perception.
