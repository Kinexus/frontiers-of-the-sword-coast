# Adventure Hook

- During mass migration intro, advance players from level 0 to level 1 via sparring with groups of migrants. 
    
- Become rivals with a group who you meet during the migration. 
    

  

# Rival Group

- Rival group was formed before the migration and is led by someone of noble blood that is trying to bridge their country over to the Sword Coast with and start a new kingdom that rules over the region. 
    
- Rival members will be made up of an equal number of adventurers as the PC's team.
    
- Rival group can be a mode of pushing the PCs in the right direction. They show up, brag about something, talk shit or cause problems, and leave.
    
- Rival Event - Rival team takes a job in your party’s name and due to the things they do, they give you a bad name in the local area. You will be required to find a way to either clear your name or bring them to justice. Humans that gave them the job might say they can’t tell you and the rival team apart because “all you beasts look the same to me”.
    

  

# World Ideas

- Uncover map with cloud tiles. (fog overlay or tile overlays) 
    
- Tomb or Dungeon with zombie bodies of possessed adventurers.
    
- Statues that seem normal on the way in a tomb but animate before coming back.
    
- Enter a layline and have odd things happen at random from a roll table. Hide areas of magic behind roof tiles in Foundry. 
    

  

# Crafting Ideas

- Add monster parts to boost equipment (IE boss spider carapace on armor.
    

  

# Conflict Ideas

- Powerful adventurer, Graves, leading a group of ~50 other adventurers looking to settle a kingdom where the PCs are trying to settle. Most of the followers are lower level and subservient to Graves.
    
- Interlude sessions that pull the group out of the active story to break up the monotony. A good idea would be to request a simple idea about a dream players may have while between sessions. The dream that the player comes up with could come true based on a D20 roll where 11-20 makes something about the dream come true and 0-9 makes it just a dream. 
    

  

# Monster Ideas

- House mimic 
    
- Goblin shaman
    
- Bigfoot
    

# Misc Ideas

- Play Don't Stop Me Now by Queen at the climax of battle with a fire theme. 
    
- Ether warped status. Removes the need to eat or drink, but when out of spell slots, you will begin to starve.
